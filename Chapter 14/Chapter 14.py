# Large-Scale Algorithms
# Coding example for large-scale algorithms
# PageRank is a popular algorithm used to rank web pages based on their importance and relevance. It is a great example of a large-scale algorithm that analyses a vast network of interconnected web pages. Here is a coding example in Python to demonstrate the implementation of the PageRank algorithm:
	import numpy as np
	
	def pagerank(adj_matrix, damping_factor=0.85, max_iterations=100, epsilon=1e-8):
	    num_pages = adj_matrix.shape[0]
	    teleportation_prob = (1 - damping_factor) / num_pages
	
	    # Initialize the page ranks with equal probabilities
	    page_ranks = np.ones(num_pages) / num_pages
	
	    for _ in range(max_iterations):
	        prev_page_ranks = page_ranks.copy()
	
	        for i in range(num_pages):
	            # Calculate the sum of incoming page ranks
	            incoming_ranks = np.sum(adj_matrix[:, i] * prev_page_ranks) 
	
	            # Update the page rank for the current page
	            page_ranks[i] = teleportation_prob + damping_factor * incoming_ranks
	
	        # Check for convergence
	        if np.linalg.norm(page_ranks - prev_page_ranks) < epsilon:
	            break
	
	    return page_ranks
	
	# Example usage
	adj_matrix = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 0],
	                      [1, 0, 1, 0],
	                      [1, 1, 0, 1],
	                      [0, 0, 1, 0]])
	
	result = pagerank(adj_matrix)
	print("Page Ranks:", result)

# Exercise and solutions
# Exercise: Word count using MapReduce
# Objective: Familiarize yourself with the fundamental MapReduce paradigm by implementing the classic "word count" problem on a large dataset.
# Instructions:
# 1.	Dataset: Use a large text dataset (like a book or collection of articles). For this exercise, you can use the plain text version of a public domain book from Project Gutenberg (e.g., "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy).
# 2.	Implementation
#   a.	Split the text data into chunks.
#   b.	Create a map function to process each chunk and produce a set of key-value pairs (word, 1).
#   c.	Shuffle and sort these key-value pairs by their keys (words).
#   d.	Create a reduce function to sum the counts for each word.
# 3.	Code (Python-like pseudo-code for simplicity)
	def map(chunk):
	    words = chunk.split()
	    return [(word, 1) for word in words]
	
	def reduce(key, values):
	    return key, sum(values)
	
	# Simulating the MapReduce process
	text_data = open("large_text_file.txt").read()
	chunks = split_into_chunks(text_data, chunk_size=1000)  # Define this function as per your needs
	
	mapped_values = []
	for chunk in chunks:
	    mapped_values.extend(map(chunk))
	
	# Sort and shuffle
	mapped_values.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
	
	reduced_values = {}
	for key, group in groupby(mapped_values, key=lambda x: x[0]):  # Using itertools.groupby
	    word, word_count = reduce(key, [value[1] for value in group])
	    reduced_values[word] = word_count
	
	print(reduced_values)

# 4.	Tasks:
#   a.	Implement the pseudo-code in a real Python environment.
#   b.	Optimize the chunk size and observe any changes in performance.
#   c.	Compare your results with another word count tool or method.
#   d.	Reflect on the scalability of this approach: How would this change if you had 10GB of text data? How about 1TB?
# 5.	Advanced: If you have access to a Hadoop environment or any MapReduce framework, try implementing the word count problem there and compare the performance.
