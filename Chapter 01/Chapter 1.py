# Classic examples of AI and ML
# Here are a few classic examples of projects in the fields of AI and ML, along with simplified source code snippets. Let us dive in:
#	Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotion behind a given text. Here is a simple example using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library:
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
	
	def analyze_sentiment(text):
	    analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
	    sentiment_scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(text)
	    sentiment = sentiment_scores['compound']
	    
	    if sentiment >= 0.05:
	        return 'Positive'
	    elif sentiment <= -0.05:
            return 'Negative'
	    else:
	        return 'Neutral'
	
	# Example usage
	text = "I love this movie!"
	sentiment = analyze_sentiment(text)
	print(sentiment)

#	Image classification: Image classification involves training a model to classify images into predefined categories. Here is an example using Python, TensorFlow, and the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset:
	import tensorflow as tf
	from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
	
	# Load the MNIST dataset
	(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
	
	# Preprocess the data
	train_images = train_images / 255.0
	test_images = test_images / 255.0
	
	# Build and train the model
	model = tf.keras.Sequential([
	    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
	    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
	    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
	])
	
	model.compile(optimizer='adam',
	              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
	              metrics=['accuracy'])
	
	model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5)
	
	# Evaluate the model
	test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
	print(f'Test accuracy: {test_accuracy}')

#	Spam detection: Spam detection aims to classify emails or messages as spam or not spam. Here is a basic example using Python and scikit-learn:
	from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
	from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
	from sklearn.svm import SVC
	
	# Sample email dataset
	emails = [
	    ("Hello, this is a legitimate email."),
	    ("Get a free vacation now! Limited time offer!"),
	    ("Your bank account has been compromised. Please update your information."),
	    # ... more emails
	]
	labels = [0, 1, 1]  # 0 for legitimate, 1 for spam
	
	# Vectorize the emails
	vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
	features = vectorizer.fit_transform(emails)
	
	# Split the dataset
	X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2)
	
	# Train the classifier
	classifier = SVC()
	classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
	
	# Predict labels for new emails
	new_emails = [
	    ("Hello, just wanted to say hi!"),
	    ("You've won a million dollars! Claim your prize now!")
	]
	new_features = vectorizer.transform(new_emails)
	predictions = classifier.predict(new_features)
	print(predictions)
