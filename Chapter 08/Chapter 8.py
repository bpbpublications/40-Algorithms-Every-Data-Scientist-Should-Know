# Real world coding example
# Here is a simplified Python example of using Q-Learning for optimizing an industrial process. Let us say we have an assembly line with two machines (Machine A and Machine B), and we have two different jobs (Job 1 and Job 2).
# The jobs take different amounts of time on each machine: Job 1 takes 10 minutes on Machine A and 20 minutes on Machine B, whereas Job 2 takes 15 minutes on Machine A and 15 minutes on Machine B.
# We want to learn a policy of assigning jobs to machines such that we minimize the total time taken to complete all jobs. For simplicity, we'll consider the number of jobs as finite and already known.
# Here is a simple implementation of a Q-Learning algorithm for this problem:
 	import numpy as np
 	import random
 	
 	# Define the states
 	# States are defined by the remaining jobs
 	# As we have two jobs, we have four states: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)
 	states = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
 	
 	# Define the actions
 	# Actions are defined by the job assignment to the machines: (Job for Machine A, Job for Machine B)
 	# We have four actions: (None, None), (None, Job 2), (Job 1, None), (Job 1, Job 2)
 	actions = [(None, None), (None, 2), (1, None), (1, 2)]
 	
 	# Initialize the Q-table to zeros
 	q_table = np.zeros((len(states), len(actions)))
 	
 	# Time taken by each job on each machine
 	time_taken = {(1, 'A'): 10, (1, 'B'): 20, (2, 'A'): 15, (2, 'B'): 15}

 	    else:

# Real world coding example
# A specific example of how DQN could be used in energy management is in optimizing the operation of a grid-connected battery for storing solar power.
# The aim would be to learn a policy for when to store power in the battery and when to sell it back to the grid to maximize profit, given fluctuating energy prices and solar power generation.
# We can simplify this scenario to have three actions:
# •	Store the power in the battery.
# •	Sell the power to the grid.
# •	Do nothing.
# Assume that we can obtain the data for solar power generation and grid energy prices, and that the state at each time step includes the current battery charge level, current solar power generation, and current energy price.

# Real world coding example
# Creating a complete A2C-based autonomous vehicle model would be beyond the scope of this book, as it would involve complex hardware and software systems, extensive safety checks, and possibly confidential or proprietary data. However, to give a sense of how A2C can be applied to a simplified version of this problem, we can create an agent that learns to control a car in a simple simulator environment, such as the MountainCarContinuous-v0 environment from OpenAI's gym.
# In the MountainCarContinuous-v0 environment, the agent needs to drive an under-powered car up a steep hill. The car is on a one-dimensional track, and the agent can control the car by applying a continuous force in the range of -1 (full reverse) to +1 (full forward).

# Real world coding example
# Building a real-world robotics application using TRPO would involve several steps, including setting up a real robot or a simulation environment, collecting data from the robot's sensors, implementing the TRPO algorithm (or using an existing implementation), training the robot, and finally deploying the trained policy.
# However, a full implementation of such a system is beyond the scope of this response due to the complexity and the resources involved. For this example, let's assume we're using the OpenAI Gym environment 'Pendulum-v0' which is a classic control task that could serve as a simple, abstracted version of a robotics problem. For implementing TRPO, we will use the stable baselines library which provides a high-level, easy-to-use implementation of the TRPO algorithm.
# Please install the required libraries by executing the following commands in your terminal:
 	pip install gym
 	pip install stable-baselines3[extra]
# The following Python code demonstrates how to set up and solve the 'Pendulum-v0' problem using TRPO:
 	import gym
 	from stable_baselines3 import TRPO
 	from stable_baselines3.common.policies import MlpPolicy
 	
 	# Create the environment
 	env = gym.make('Pendulum-v0')
 	
 	# Create the agent
 	model = TRPO(MlpPolicy, env, verbose=1)

 	model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
 	
 	# Test the trained agent

 	    action, _states = model.predict(state)
 	    state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
 	    env.render()

# Exercises and solutions
# Q-Learning exercise: Navigate a grid world
# Objective: Train an agent using Q-learning to navigate a simple grid world to reach the target while avoiding obstacles.
# Environment
# •	A 5x5 grid world.

# 3.	Initialize a Q-table with zeros.
# Tasks
# 1.	Environment setup
#   a.	Create a reward matrix for the grid. Assign +10 for the goal, -10 for the obstacles, and -1 for other squares to encourage the shortest path.
# 2.	Q-Learning implementation
#   a.	Choose an action based on a policy derived from the current Q-values (e.g., ε-greedy).
