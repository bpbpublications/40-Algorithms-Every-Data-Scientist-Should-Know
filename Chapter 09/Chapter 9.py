# Real world coding example
# Optimizing a supply chain using reinforcement learning like A3C can be quite complex because of the variety of factors involved in a real-world supply chain. These can include product demand, warehousing, distribution, inventory management, and so forth. Thus, a real-world example can be quite elaborate.
# However, let us consider a simplified scenario of inventory management. We will use a simple inventory model where each day, we can place an order to replenish stock, and the goal is to minimize the cost of holding inventory and the cost of stockouts (not having an item when it's needed).
# To use A3C with this scenario, we would first need to define an environment that captures this problem. Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, provides a framework to create such an environment.
# Given the complexity of this problem, we will only provide a high-level idea of how one might structure this environment and A3C algorithm to solve it. The actual implementation requires significant effort and expertise in reinforcement learning and supply chain management.
# Here is a rough skeleton of how it might look:
 	import gym
 	from gym import spaces
 	import numpy as np
 	
 	class InventoryEnv(gym.Env):
 	    def __init__(self, max_inventory=100, max_order=20, holding_cost=1, stockout_cost=5):
 	        super(InventoryEnv, self).__init__()

 	        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(self.max_order + 1)

 	        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=np.array([0]), high=np.array([self.max_inventory]))

 	        self.inventory = min(self.inventory + action, self.max_inventory)

 	        if self.inventory < demand:
 	            cost = self.stockout_cost * (demand - self.inventory)
 	            self.inventory = 0
 	        else:
 	            self.inventory -= demand

# Real world coding example
One of the most common applications of PPO is training agents to play games. In the following example, we will use the ‘stable-baselines3’ library to train an agent to play the classic game of CartPole in the OpenAI Gym:

# Real world coding example
# DDPG has been used in several studies for controlling and optimizing power systems. These systems are usually represented as complex simulation environments with state variables and continuous control actions.
# Due to the complexity of real-world power systems, these examples usually require specific domain knowledge and substantial computational resources, and thus are beyond the scope of a simple Python example.
# However, we can use the OpenAI Gym's ‘Pendulum-v0’ as a toy model to represent a power system in a simplified manner. In this example, we consider the pendulum's angle to represent the state of a power system, and the force applied to it as a control action.

# Real world coding example
# Creating a realistic traffic light control system using TD3 is a complex task. A real-world implementation would require an accurate simulation of traffic flows, including vehicle speeds, arrival times, and intersection dynamics. Such a system would also need to account for multiple traffic lights and optimize their timings jointly to improve overall traffic flow. Creating such a simulation is beyond the scope of a simple Python example.
# However, to give you an idea, we can design a simplified system where a single traffic light manages the flow of vehicles from two directions. The action is the duration for which the light stays green for each direction, and the reward is negatively proportional to the total wait time of all vehicles.
# Here is a conceptual example:
	import gym
	from stable_baselines3 import TD3
	from stable_baselines3.common.noise import NormalActionNoise
	from traffic_environment import TrafficEnvironment  # This should be a custom designed environment
	
	# Create traffic environment

# Soft Actor-Critic
# Here is a coding example using the ‘stable_baselines3’ library to implement SAC for the ‘Pendulum-v0’ environment from OpenAI Gym:

# TD3 Exercise: Controlling a Bipedal Robot with TD3
# Objective: Use the TD3 algorithm to train an agent to make a bipedal robot walk in the BipedalWalker-v3 environment provided by OpenAI's Gym library.
# Environment
# •	BipedalWalker-v3: The agent must control a bipedal robot to make it walk forward on a randomly generated terrain. The action space is continuous.
# Setup
# 1.	Use OpenAI Gym to instantiate the BipedalWalker-v3 environment.
# 2.	Define neural network models for the actor (policy) and the twin critics (Q-values).
# Tasks
# 1.	Environment setup:
#   a.	Install and import necessary libraries.
#   b.	Initialize the BipedalWalker-v3 environment.
# 2.	Model definition:
#   a.	Define neural networks for the actor and the two critics.
# 3.	TD3 implementation:
#   a.	Implement Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise or other noise methods for exploration.
#   b.	Set up the experience replay buffer.
#   c.	Collect experiences, then sample from the buffer to update actor and critics.
#   d.	Implement policy delay and target noise.
#   e.	Maintain two Q-functions (twin critics) and use the smaller Q-value to update the actor.
# 4.	Evaluation:
#   a.	After certain training intervals, test the agent's performance over several episodes.
# Code implementation:
	import gym
	import numpy as np
	# Import your deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch)
	
	# Initialize environment
	env = gym.make('BipedalWalker-v3')
	state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]
	action_size = env.action_space.shape[0]
	
	# Neural Network Model Definitions
	# Define your actor and twin critic models here
	
	# Experience Replay Buffer
	class ReplayBuffer:
	    # Define the buffer and sampling methods here
	
	# TD3 Update Function
	def td3_update(agent, buffer):
	    # Sample experiences
	    # Update critics by minimizing the Q-value loss
	    # Delayed policy update and target networks update
	    # Use the smaller Q-value to update the actor
	
	# Training loop
	noise_process = ... # Define your noise process
	buffer = ReplayBuffer(BUFFER_SIZE)
	for episode in range(NUM_EPISODES):
	    state = env.reset()
	    while not done:
	        action = agent.act(state)
	        action += noise_process.sample()
	        # Interact with the environment
	        # Store experience in the buffer
	        td3_update(agent, buffer)
	
	    if episode % EVAL_INTERVAL == 0:
	        # Evaluate the agent's performance

# Tasks for the student:
# •	Implement the actor and twin critic networks.
# •	Apply a suitable noise process for action exploration.
# •	Implement the experience replay buffer.
# •	Apply the TD3 update rule: delay policy updates, introduce target noise, and use the minimum Q-value from the twin critics for policy updates.
# •	Ensure soft updates to the target networks.
# •	Monitor and evaluate the agent's training progress, and fine-tune hyperparameters.

# Soft Actor-Critic exercise: Training an Agent to Balance a Pendulum
# Objective: Implement the SAC algorithm to train an agent that learns to balance a pendulum upright. For this exercise, we'll use the Pendulum-v0 environment from OpenAI's Gym.
# Steps
# 1.	Setup:
#   a.	Install necessary libraries: gym, tensorflow, or pytorch (based on preference).
#   b.	Initialize the Pendulum-v0 environment.
# 2.	Building the SAC components:
#   a.	Define the neural network architectures for the Actor and the Critic.
#   b.	Implement the SAC algorithm's loss functions, including the entropy-regularized objective.
# 3.	Training:
#   a.	For a set number of episodes, use SAC to optimize the policy and Q-functions. Regularly update the target networks.
#   b.	Ensure to sample actions using a stochastic policy (with a temperature parameter) and then get the expected Q-values to update both the Actor and the Critic networks.
# 4.	Evaluation and visualization:
#   a.	After training, evaluate the agent's performance by taking the mean reward over a set number of test episodes.
#   b.	Visualize the learning curve (episode rewards over time).
# 5.	Fine-tuning:
#   a.	Experiment with different hyperparameters such as the learning rate, temperature, discount factor (gamma), and target update rate.

# Task for the student:
# •	Implement the SAC algorithm for the Pendulum-v0 environment.
# •	Plot the rewards obtained per episode during training. How many episodes does it take to achieve consistent performance?
# •	Compare the SAC agent's performance with that of a standard DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients) agent in the same environment. Which algorithm stabilizes the pendulum faster?
# •	Bonus: Apply the SAC algorithm to another continuous action space environment from OpenAI's Gym, like LunarLanderContinuous-v2. Observe the differences in performance and training time.
